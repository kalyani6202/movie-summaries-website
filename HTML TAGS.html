    <P>Bahubali: The Beginning is an epic Indian historical action drama directed by S.S. Rajamouli. The film opens with a dramatic scene where a woman, Sivagami, escapes from soldiers while carrying an infant. She sacrifices her life to save the child, who is rescued by villagers and raised as Shivudu at the base of a massive waterfall.

Shivudu grows up as a strong, adventurous young man, constantly drawn toward the top of the waterfall. Despite many failed attempts, his curiosity and determination eventually help him scale the waterfall. At the top, he enters a new world full of mystery and conflict.

There, he meets Avantika, a fierce warrior and part of a rebel group fighting against the tyrannical rule of King Bhallaladeva of Mahishmati. Avantika has been assigned a mission to rescue Devasena, a queen who has been imprisoned and chained in the kingdom for 25 years. Shivudu falls in love with Avantika and, to prove his love, takes up her mission himself.

Shivudu sneaks into Mahishmati and rescues Devasena. During this mission, his extraordinary strength and bravery catch the attention of the kingdom’s people. Eventually, the royal guards recognize him, and a dramatic confrontation follows. It is revealed that Shivudu is not just an ordinary man—he is Mahendra Bahubali, the son of the great warrior prince Amarendra Bahubali.

The story then shifts into an extended flashback showing the history of Amarendra Bahubali and his cousin Bhallaladeva. Both were raised by Sivagami, the queen mother, and trained to be future rulers of Mahishmati. Amarendra, noble and kind, earned the love of the people, while Bhallaladeva, cunning and power-hungry, was driven by jealousy.

A war breaks out against a savage invader named Kalakeya. Both princes lead the army, and Amarendra proves to be a brilliant, selfless leader. His heroism in battle wins him the crown, chosen by Sivagami herself.

However, Bhallaladeva and his father Bijjaladeva plot against Amarendra. They twist circumstances and deceive Sivagami, leading to Amarendra's assassination. The flashback ends with a major twist—Kattappa, the loyal royal commander and narrator of the story, confesses that he killed Amarendra Bahubali.

The film ends with this shocking revelation, leaving the audience with the question: Why did Kattappa kill Bahubali?

The first part of the saga sets the foundation for themes of betrayal, destiny, and justice. Shivudu, now aware of his true heritage, takes on his father’s legacy and vows to restore justice and reclaim the throne of Mahishmati.

Bahubali: The Beginning is not just a tale of war and politics, but also of love, loyalty, and sacrifice. With grand visuals, powerful characters, and a gripping narrative, the film became a cultural phenomenon, setting the stage for its sequel, Bahubali: The Conclusion, where all mysteries are unraveled.

<P>Baahubali: The Conclusion continues the epic saga where Baahubali: The Beginning left off, unraveling the mystery behind the betrayal and death of Amarendra Baahubali, and how his son Mahendra Baahubali (Shivudu) rises to avenge him.

The film begins with a flashback narrated by Kattappa, the royal commander, who had shockingly revealed in the first part that he killed Amarendra Baahubali. Kattappa explains the events that led to the tragedy.

After Amarendra is declared heir to the throne of Mahishmati by Queen Mother Sivagami, he is sent across the kingdom to understand his people better before officially becoming king. During his travels, he meets Devasena, the princess of the neighboring kingdom of Kuntala, and they fall in love. He promises to marry her, unaware that Sivagami had already arranged her marriage to Bhallaladeva.

When Devasena rejects the proposal sent by Sivagami, insulted by her response, Sivagami feels betrayed and instead crowns Bhallaladeva as king. Amarendra accepts the decision and becomes commander of the army, still loyal to Sivagami and Mahishmati.

Tensions grow between Amarendra, Devasena, and the ruling family. Bhallaladeva, driven by jealousy and hatred, begins a campaign to tarnish Amarendra’s image. He manipulates situations to turn Sivagami against Amarendra. Eventually, Sivagami, misled by lies, orders Amarendra’s execution for treason.

Bound by his duty to the throne, Kattappa reluctantly kills Amarendra in a heartbreaking scene. However, when Sivagami learns the truth and realizes her mistake, she tries to save Amarendra’s infant son. She escapes the palace with the baby but is attacked. Before dying, she places the child in the river — the same baby who grows up to be Shivudu (Mahendra Baahubali).

Back in the present, Shivudu learns the truth about his father’s murder and vows to take back Mahishmati. He leads a rebellion against Bhallaladeva, who has ruled the kingdom with cruelty for 25 years, keeping Devasena imprisoned and humiliating her publicly.

With the help of Kattappa, Avantika, and the loyal people of Mahishmati, Shivudu attacks the kingdom. A massive battle ensues, filled with strategic warfare, fierce combat, and powerful confrontations. Ultimately, Shivudu defeats Bhallaladeva in an epic showdown.

In a symbolic end, Devasena personally executes Bhallaladeva by burning him alive, ending the tyranny and restoring justice. Shivudu is crowned as the rightful king of Mahishmati, with Devasena and Avantika by his side. He promises to rule with fairness and dignity, as his father once did.

The film ends on a hopeful note, with peace returning to Mahishmati and the people celebrating their new ruler. Kattappa, relieved of his guilt, finally finds peace, having served both father and son with loyalty.

Baahubali: The Conclusion ties together all the emotional and political threads from the first film, highlighting themes of justice, honor, betrayal, and legacy. It delivers a powerful conclusion to a grand tale, cementing its place as one of Indian cinema’s most iconic stories.

<P>Arya is a Telugu romantic action-comedy film directed by Sukumar and marks the rise of Allu Arjun as a star. The film presents a fresh take on love, obsession, and sacrifice, revolving around three main characters: Arya, Geetha, and Ajay.

The story begins when Geetha, a beautiful and reserved girl, joins a new college in Vizag. She is already in a secret relationship with Ajay, the son of a powerful and influential MP. Ajay is a possessive lover who uses his father’s political power to control things around him. However, their relationship remains hidden due to fear of public exposure and consequences.

Enter Arya, a carefree, quirky, and cheerful guy who falls in love with Geetha at first sight. Without hesitation, he proposes to her the very next day, even though he knows she is already in love with someone else. Geetha rejects him, but Arya doesn't give up. Instead of feeling heartbroken, he starts helping her and Ajay, believing that true love is about seeing the one you love happy—even if it's not with you.

Arya’s strange yet charming personality begins to influence everyone around him, including Geetha, though she remains committed to Ajay. Arya’s selfless actions and good-hearted nature slowly start to confuse Geetha, especially when she notices the possessive and controlling side of Ajay.

When Ajay’s father learns about his son's relationship with Geetha, he opposes it strongly and plans to marry her off to someone else. Ajay, afraid of his father's power, asks Arya for help in eloping with Geetha. Arya, without any selfish motive, agrees and helps them escape.

During the journey, Arya continues to act selflessly, taking care of Geetha and doing everything to ensure she is safe and happy. But along the way, Geetha starts to see the difference between the two men: Ajay, who only wants to possess her, and Arya, who genuinely loves her without expecting anything in return.

Eventually, Ajay abandons Geetha out of fear and selfishness, but Arya stays by her side. At this point, Geetha realizes Arya’s love is true, pure, and unconditional. Moved by his sincerity and sacrifice, she starts developing feelings for him.

In the climax, Arya fights Ajay’s men and overcomes several challenges to protect Geetha. She finally confesses her love for Arya, accepting him as the one who truly loves her—not for himself, but for her happiness.

The film ends with Arya and Geetha united, celebrating a love that was not forced, but earned through patience, sacrifice, and genuine care.

Arya is known for its unique storytelling, humorous dialogues, emotional depth, and Allu Arjun’s energetic performance. Unlike typical love stories, it explores what it means to truly love someone—putting their happiness above your own. It became a huge commercial success and established Sukumar’s reputation as a director who brings freshness to Telugu cinema.

<P>Arya 2 is a psychological romantic action drama directed by Sukumar, starring Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep. Though it shares the name and lead actor with Arya (2004), it is not a direct sequel but a standalone story that explores the complexities of friendship, love, and obsession.

The story begins with Arya, an orphan with deep psychological issues and obsessive tendencies. He has one close friend, Ajay, also an orphan. Arya is possessive about Ajay and constantly tries to be the most important person in his life, often in overbearing ways. Despite Arya's eccentric and manipulative behavior, Ajay tolerates him because of their shared past.

As adults, Ajay becomes the head of a successful software company. When Arya unexpectedly re-enters his life, Ajay reluctantly hires him due to pressure from the staff who are impressed by Arya’s technical skills. Arya tries to become the most popular person in the company, often creating chaos with his strange, childish antics.

The plot thickens when both Arya and Ajay fall in love with Geetha, a new employee in the company. Geetha is sweet, traditional, and principled. She is initially charmed by Ajay, who pretends to be kind and ideal, although he is manipulative underneath. Arya, on the other hand, confesses his love for Geetha early on but comes across as obsessive and crazy.

Geetha initially dislikes Arya for his behavior, but over time, she starts noticing his true emotions, loyalty, and the sacrifices he makes for her and Ajay. Arya even suppresses his own love to ensure Ajay and Geetha’s happiness, despite Ajay constantly humiliating and lying to him.

Eventually, Geetha discovers Ajay’s true nature and realizes that Arya, though flawed and emotionally unstable, is the one who genuinely loves her. Meanwhile, Arya continues to fight his inner demons—his obsessive personality, extreme possessiveness, and emotional dependence on both Ajay and Geetha.

A turning point comes when Arya finally understands that true love cannot be forced. In a moment of maturity and emotional growth, he steps back, giving Geetha the freedom to choose for herself. This act of selflessness shows his transformation from an obsessive lover to someone capable of real love.

In the climax, after a series of emotional confrontations and dramatic events, Geetha chooses Arya, realizing his love is unconditional and genuine. Ajay is left alone, having lost both a friend and the woman he loved due to his selfishness and deceit.

The film ends with Arya and Geetha together, and Arya finally finding peace in a relationship built on acceptance and love, rather than obsession.

Arya 2 is a unique love story that dives deep into the mind of a disturbed but lovable character. The film combines romance, comedy, and action with a psychological layer, driven by Allu Arjun’s powerful performance, stylish music, and Sukumar’s trademark storytelling. It stands out for showing that love is not about control or need—but about letting go and being selfless.
